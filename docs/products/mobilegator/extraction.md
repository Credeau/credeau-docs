# DeviceInsights: MobileGator SMS Extraction API

The SMS Extraction API provides programmatic access to extract structured features from SMS messages. This endpoint accepts SMS message data as input and returns extracted features such as transaction patterns, merchant information, financial data, and other relevant metadata parsed from the message content.

## Base URL

```bash
https://deviceinsights.credeau.com
```

## Variables

The following variables will be referenced throughout this documentation:

### Success Responses

#### HTTP 200 OK (Success)

The API returns different response structures based on the user data availability.

    ]
}
```

**Case 2: User Data Not Available**

When the API is called before user data is synced from the SDK or when data synchronization failed due to technical issues (such as network connectivity problems, app crashes, missing permissions, or abrupt app termination) -

```json
{
    "extracted_sms_data": []
}
```

---

### Error Responses

#### HTTP 401 Unauthorized (Wrong credentials)

This error occurs when either an invalid client ID or authentication token is provided in the request headers. The response includes a request ID that can be used for troubleshooting.

```json
{
    "error": "Could not validate credentials. (request_id=<request_id>). It has been logged successfully on our servers. Please contact us with the request_id for assistance."
}
```

> ⚠️ **Note**
>
> If you receive this error:
>
> 1. Verify that you're using the correct client ID and authentication token
> 2. Contact Credeau support with the request_id for assistance

---

#### HTTP 403 Forbidden (Invalid Access)

This error can occur in two scenarios:

1. **IP Not Whitelisted**: When the requesting IP address is not whitelisted in the Credeau firewall. For security reasons, all API requests must originate from pre-approved IP addresses.

2. **Incorrect API Path**: When an incorrect or misspelled API path is used in the request URL.

```html
<html>
    <head><title>403 Forbidden</title></head>
    <body>
        <center><h1>403 Forbidden</h1></center>
    </body>
</html>
```

> ⚠️ **Note**
>
> To resolve this error:
>
> 1. Verify that you're using the correct API endpoint path
> 2. If the path is correct, contact Credeau support to whitelist your IP address
> 3. Provide your organization's name and the IP address(es) that need access
> 4. Once whitelisted, you'll be able to access the API from the approved IP addresses

---

#### HTTP 422 Unprocessable Content (Wrong Request Payload)

This error is returned when any of the required parameters (`user_id`, `client_id`, or `groupings`) is missing from the request payload. The response includes details about which fields are missing and the received input.

```json
{
    "detail": [
        {
            "type": "missing",
            "loc": [
                "body",
                "user_id"
            ],
            "msg": "Field required",
            "input": {
                "client_id": "<client_id>",
                "cnt_sms_threshold": 10
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

---

#### HTTP 429 Too Many Requests (Rate Limit Exceeded)

This error is returned when the rate of requests exceeds the allowed limit of 1000 requests per minute per IP.

**Best Practice for Rate Limit Handling**

When implementing retries for rate-limited requests:

1. Use exponential backoff: Start with a base delay (e.g., 1 second) and double it after each retry
2. Add jitter: Include random variation (±20%) to the delay to prevent thundering herd problems

Example implementation:

```python
import random
import time
def get_retry_delay(attempt, base_delay=1, max_delay=60):
    # Calculate exponential backoff
    delay = min(base_delay * (2 ** attempt), max_delay)
    # Add jitter (±20%)
    jitter = delay * 0.2
    return delay + random.uniform(-jitter, jitter)
```

This approach helps distribute retry attempts and prevents overwhelming the API when rate limits are hit.
