# NameMatch API

The NameMatch API provides programmatic access to our specialized NameMatching engine, delivering precise identity verification and deduplication capabilities with advanced support for Indian names and their linguistic variations.

## Base URL

```bash
https://gator.credeau.com
```

## Endpoints

### NameMatch API

```bash
POST /api/name_match
```

## Authentication

The API requires two authentication headers:

| Header | Value |
|--------|-------|
| `x-client-id` | `<client_id>` |
| `x-auth-token` | `<auth_token>` |

and, one content type header:

| Header | Value |
|--------|-------|
| `Content-Type` | `application/json` |

### Error Responses

#### HTTP 401 Unauthorized (Wrong credentials)

This error occurs when either an invalid client ID or authentication token is provided in the request headers.

> ⚠️ **Note**
>
> If you receive this error:

> 1. Verify that you're using the correct client ID and authentication token
> 2. Contact Credeau support

---

#### HTTP 403 Forbidden (Invalid Access)

This error can occur when the requesting IP address is not whitelisted in the Credeau firewall. For security reasons, all API requests must originate from pre-approved IP addresses.

```html
<html>
    <head><title>403 Forbidden</title></head>
    <body>
        <center><h1>403 Forbidden</h1></center>
    </body>
</html>
```

> ⚠️ **Note**
>
> To resolve this error:
>
> 1. Contact Credeau support to whitelist your IP address
> 2. Provide your organization's name and the IP address(es) that need access
> 3. Once whitelisted, you'll be able to access the API from the approved IP addresses

---

#### HTTP 422 Unprocessable Content (Wrong Request Payload)

This error is returned when any of the required parameters is missing from the request payload. The response includes details about which fields are missing and the received input.

```json
{
    "detail": [
        {
            "type": "missing",
            "loc": [
                "body",
                "user_id"
            ],
            "msg": "Field required",
            "input": {
                "source_name": "...",
                "target_name": "..."
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

---

#### HTTP 429 Too Many Requests (Rate Limit Exceeded)

This error is returned when the rate of requests exceeds the allowed limit of 1000 requests per minute per IP.

**Best Practice for Rate Limit Handling**

When implementing retries for rate-limited requests:

1. Use exponential backoff: Start with a base delay (e.g., 1 second) and double it after each retry
2. Add jitter: Include random variation (±20%) to the delay to prevent thundering herd problems

Example implementation:

```python
import random
import time
def get_retry_delay(attempt, base_delay=1, max_delay=60):
    # Calculate exponential backoff
    delay = min(base_delay * (2 ** attempt), max_delay)
    # Add jitter (±20%)
    jitter = delay * 0.2
    return delay + random.uniform(-jitter, jitter)
```

This approach helps distribute retry attempts and prevents overwhelming the API when rate limits are hit.
