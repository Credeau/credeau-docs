# Scaling MobileForge

## Overview

MobileForge supports horizontal and vertical scaling to accommodate varying workloads.

## Scaling Strategies

- **Horizontal Scaling**: Add more instances of services to distribute load.
- **Vertical Scaling**: Increase resources (CPU, RAM) of existing instances.

## Resource Provisioning

- Monitor system metrics to determine scaling needs.
- Use container orchestration tools (e.g., Kubernetes) for automated scaling.
