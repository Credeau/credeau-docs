# Components

MobileForge consists of the following core components:

- **Authentication Service**: Manages user authentication and authorization.
- **API Gateway**: Routes requests to appropriate services.
- **Data Service**: Handles data storage and retrieval.
- **Notification Service**: Sends push notifications to users.

Each component is designed to be modular and can be scaled independently.
